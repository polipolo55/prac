Cuando pierda todas las partidas / Cuando duerma con la soledad / Cuando se me cierren las salidas / Y la noche no me deje en paz.

In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret, For none could tame our savage souls yet you the challenge met, Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were redeemed, A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed. Our cherished dreams you granted and delivered more, But in dismay you found too late our desires had no end, What cost to tame our savagery? You gave your all and then gave more, Yet desires still lay unquenched, more dreams remained, your energy. Amongst it spread a dreadful scourge, That forced return our aggressive urge, And turned us back to beasts or husks, Our souls consumed to the light above. Within your corpse can still be heard the plaintiff cries of one, Who took our pain, and loss, and dreams inside itself to... Through it’s pain we found a truth that must now be confessed, For nothing can contain such things but perfect emptiness.

Don't think sorry's easily said Don't try turning tables instead You've taken lots of Chances before But I'm not gonna give anymore Don't ask me That's how it goes Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin' Don't say words you're gonna regret Don't let the fire rush to your head I've heard the accusation before And I ain't gonna take any more Believe me The sun in your Eyes Made some of the lies worth believing I am the eye in the sky Looking at you I can read your mind I am the maker of rules Dealing with fools I can cheat you blind And I don't need to see any more To know that I can read your mind, I can read your mind Don't leave false illusions behind Don't cry cause I ain't changing my mind So find another fool like before Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving I am the eye in the sky Looking at you I can read your mind I am the maker of rules Dealing with fools I can cheat you blind And I don't need to see any more To know that I can read your mind, I can read your mind

On a dark desert highway Cool wind in my hair Warm smell of colitas Rising up through the air Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell And I was thinking to myself "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell" Then she lit up a candle And she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (such a lovely place) Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year (any time of year) You can find it here Her mind is Tiffany-twisted She got the Mercedes Benz She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys That she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard Sweet summer sweat Some dance to remember Some dance to forget So I called up the Captain "Please bring me my wine" He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here Since 1969" And still those voices are calling from far away Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (such a lovely place) Such a lovely face They livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling The pink champagne on ice And she said, 'We are all just prisoners here Of our own device" And in the master's chambers They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives But they just can't kill the beast Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before "Relax, " said the night man "We are programmed to receive You can check out any time you like But you can never leave"

The Dreamers are three beings who entered into an eternal sleep in order to use their power to seal away the Hollow Knight.[1] The ones who became the Dreamers are Monomon the Teacher, Lurien the Watcher, and Herrah the Beast. Their seals are present on the exterior of the Black Egg located in the Temple of the Black Egg. The Knight encounters two projections of the Dreamers. The first time is in Greenpath after picking up the Mothwing Cloak. The second time is in the Resting Grounds after inspecting the Dreamers memorial. Both times the Dreamers tell the Knight to stop trying to break their Seals. In the Resting Grounds, the Dreamers attempt to prevent the Knight from finding their resting bodies by trapping the Knight in the Dream Realm. After finding a Dreamer's physical body, using the Dream Nail on their body sends the Knight into a Dream that contains a vulnerable form of that Dreamer. Killing this form and absorbing it using Focus breaks their respective Seal.
